# README

This is a repo for the final product of a groupwork coursework.
This is a webapp that scrapes websites and discovers information about a brand related to their sustainability.
It then rates their sustainability and outputs it on a webpage along with brand information and other information

This webapp is no longer functional or deployable but the code is still viewable here.
